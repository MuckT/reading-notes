- Feedback is a gift - Some of the first Feedback John received on Hyperseek told him that the name sucked and he wasn't charging enough.
- People equate quality with price tripled the number of sales going from $79 to $399.
- Get a Patent if you can & Trademark the names of your products - John was using iWeb in 1999ish. Apple acquired this trademark in 2006.
