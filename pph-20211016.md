# Q and A with [Ryan Pedersen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rp74)

### Intro

- The difference between a know it all vs a learn it all. A known it all isn't that useful in a constantly changing field. A learn it all shows a natural curiosity. 
- A growth mindset. Be willing to share the process including the bumps and bruises.

### Transitions
 
- Titles are more about the years spent an the industry.
- Transitions within organizations are possible, you might not know it's an option if you don't ask.
- Ageism in Tech is a thing, but as most places are currently looking for developers this is less of an issue if you're willing to learn.

### Languages at Microsoft

- Primarily C# and .NET; however, there are teams working in Python, Javascript and Java.
- When Applying you are not expected to be fluent in a certain language, but you are expected to be willing to learn: this goes back to having a growth mindset.

### Take The Best Playbook

- If you see someone with a playbook you like steal it.
- If you see parts you like adapt it to your own.
- Understand how someone thinks about the problem, not just how they solved it.
- You need to be able to express the problem to others.
