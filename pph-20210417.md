# White Boarding - [Raven Robertson](https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/in/raven-robertson "Raven Robertson LinkedIn")

## Brief on Data Structures  - A way to store data

- How we file them away
- How to retrieve them
- How to mutate

### Data Structure Types

- Queues: FIFO (first in, first out)

- Stacks: LIFO (last in, first out)

- Hashmaps: An object that holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys.

- Arrays: A special kind of JavaScript Object. Unlike the Object data structure, they do not have the key: value pairs but singular data in them.

```JavaScript
// Hashmaps in JavaScript
let contacts = new Map()
contacts.set('Jessie', {phone: "213-555-1234", address: "123 N 1st Ave"})
contacts.has('Jessie') // true
contacts.get('Hilary') // undefined
contacts.set('Hilary', {phone: "617-555-4321", address: "321 S 2nd St"})
contacts.get('Jessie') // {phone: "213-555-1234", address: "123 N 1st Ave"}
contacts.delete('Raymond') // false
contacts.delete('Jessie') // true
console.log(contacts.size) // 1
```

```JavaScript
// Arrays in JavaScript
let sequence = [1, 2, 3];
sequence.push(4);
sequence.push(5);
console.log(sequence);
// → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(sequence.pop());
// → 5
console.log(sequence);
// → [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Sample White Board - Fizz Buzz

```JavaScript
// Problem: Given a max number, print out fizz for numbers divisible by 3 and buzz for numbers divisible by 5, 
// print out fizz buzz if both and the number if none.
// https://stackoverflow.com/a/29559488/7967484
var tempArray = Array.from(Array(101).keys()).slice(1,101)

console.log("\n_____With A forEach Loop_____\n")
tempArray.forEach(item => {
  if(item % 3 === 0 && item % 5 === 0){
    console.log('fizz buzz');
  } else if (item % 3 === 0) {
    console.log('fizz');
  } else if (item % 5 === 0) {
    console.log('buzz')
  } else {
    console.log(item);
  }
});
```

### Questions to ask

- What are the requirements?

- How should data be presented and stored?

- Examples: best case - worst/unusual case?

- What are you allowed to use e.g. built in methods?

### Things to think about

- What’s important to your interviewer?
- Is optimization important?
- How will you loop through your data - what data structures or looping methods are most appropriate?
- If you’re breaking down a problem, which parts are important; if you can’t complete at least you’ve solved a portion of it?

### What to do

- Slow down, Listen, Ask good questions & Process (SLAP)

- Think things out loud.

- Try to have a conversation with your interviewer.

#### Examples of [good questions](https://github.com/nourimeals/documents/blob/master/Getting-Started/how_to_ask_questions.md "How to Ask Good Questions")

- This is what I know…

- These are the requirements…

- This is the problem…

- This is how I might approach it…

- Plus side to my thinking…

- Down side to my thinking...

### Break Down Whiteboard into 3 portions - Verify with interviewer

1. Gather Requirements
2. Get Examples, Cases, Edge Cases: what data are you given, what’s the expected output
3. Outline - Pseudo Code

<b>If you complete early, new requirements might be coming!</b>

#### Remember to

- Draw / illustrate things out when you can.

- Take a moment with every step to verify with the interviewer you are going the right direction.

- Verify, Converse - Find problems to your approaches early.

### Moving forward

- Fail fast - Riskiest Assumptions Test (RAT)

- You are also interviewing your interviewer

- See how they work and collaborate.

- See if they will provider what you need to grow as a developer.

- Will they provider a good working environment.

- Collect data.

- On problems and questions that are being used.

- How you did, what could you have done better.

#### Takes notes after the interview (Collecting Data)

- What went well?

- What problems were used?

- Impressions?

- Things you noticed with the process and the people you talked to?

#### Use the Collected Data to

- To improve your interviewing skills.

- To get better at choosing where to apply. Where is it worth your time and effort?

- To see how you are actually doing better today than yesterday.
