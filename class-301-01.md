## React Tutorial through Passing Data Through Props

* React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

* In JavaScript classes, you need to always call super when defining the constructor of a subclass. All React component classes that have a constructor should start with a super(props) call.

* Split the returned element into multiple lines for readability and add parentheses so that JavaScript doesn’t insert a semicolon after return.

```JavaScript
  renderSquare(i) {
    return (
      <Square
        value={this.state.squares[i]}
        onClick={() => this.handleClick(i)}
      />
    );
  }
```

* Two approaches to changing data

  * Data change with mutation - changing data directly. Detecting changes is difficult.

  * Data change without mutation - makes complex features easier to implement. Immutable data can easily determine if changes have been made, which helps to determine whe a component requires re-rendering.

* Functional components are a simpler way to write components that only container a render method and don't have their own state.

* Unlike the array push() method you might be more familiar with, the concat() method doesn’t mutate the original array, so we prefer it.

* Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique “key” prop. Check the render method of “Game”.

### Using Keys

* It’s strongly recommended that you assign proper keys whenever you build dynamic lists.

* Instead of

```HTML
  <li>Alexa: 7 tasks left</li>
  <li>Ben: 5 tasks left</li>
```

* Use

```JXS
<li key={user.id}>{user.name}: {user.taskCount} tasks left</li>
```

## React Hello World

```JavaScript
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## Introducing JSX

* JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript

* JSX produces React “elements”.

* React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful.

* Split JSX over multiple lines for readability.

```JSX
function formatName(user) {
  return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;
}

const user = {
  firstName: 'Harper',
  lastName: 'Perez'
};

const element = (
  <h1>
    Hello, {formatName(user)}!
  </h1>
);

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### JSX Children

* If a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with `/>`

```JSX
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl} />;
```

### JSX Prevents Injection Attacks

* It is safe to embed user input in JSX

```JSX
const title = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;
// This is safe:
const element = <h1>{title}</h1>;
```

### JSX Represents Objects

* Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls.

* The following two examples are identical; React reads these objects and uses them to construct the DOM and keep it up to date.

```JXS
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);
```

```JXS
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

## Rendering Elements

* Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.

* React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes.

* React Only Updates What’s Necessary; React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.

## Components and Props

### Function and Class Components

* <bold>Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces</bold>

* The following two examples are the same from React's point of view

* A JavaScript function to defined a component

```JavaScript
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

* Using ES6 classes

```JavaScript
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

### Rendering a Component

* React elements with a DOM tag

```JSX
const element = <div />;
```

* React elements with user-defined components

```JSX
const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
```

* When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes and children to this component as a single object. We call this object “props”.

```JSX
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

* <bold>Always start component names with a capital letter</bold>. React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags.

### Composing Components

* Typically, new React apps have a single App component at the very top. However, if you integrate React into an existing app, you might start bottom-up with a small component like Button and gradually work your way to the top of the view hierarchy.

### Extracting Components

* Don’t be afraid to split components into smaller components.

* Consider the example below; It accepts author (an object), text (a string), and date (a date) as props, and describes a comment on a social media website. This component can be tricky to change because of all the nesting, and it is also hard to reuse individual parts of it. Let’s extract a few components from it.

* We recommend naming props from the component’s own point of view rather than the context in which it is being used.

* Extracting components helps to have a palette of reusable components pays off in larger apps.

* A good rule of thumb is that if a part of your UI is used several times or is complex enough on it's own it's a good candidate to be extracted to a separate component.

```JSX
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <div className="UserInfo">
        <img className="Avatar"
          src={props.author.avatarUrl}
          alt={props.author.name}
        />
        <div className="UserInfo-name">
          {props.author.name}
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

* Instead extract this to multiple components

```JSX
function Avatar(props) {
  return (
    <img className="Avatar"
      src={props.user.avatarUrl}
      alt={props.user.name}
    />
  );
}
```

```JSX
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <UserInfo user={props.author} />
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```JSX
function UserInfo(props) {
  return (
    <div className="UserInfo">
      <Avatar user={props.user} />
      <div className="UserInfo-name">
        {props.user.name}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Props are Read-Only

* Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props.

* <bold> All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.</bold>

```JavaScript
// This would be considered a 'pure component' because they do not attempt ot change their inputs and always return the same results for the same inputs
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
